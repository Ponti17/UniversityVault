# Boards
---
Two EF3-4 output boards and two wolverine input boards.

EF3-4 uses 4 output transistor pairs. 

# Power Supply
---
Choose one:
- Minimum 1000VA Linear PSU
- 1200W Micro-Audio Cobra-S2 1200W SMPS
- 1200W Hypex 64V
- Jeff Young Decoupled Stereo PSU
- Power 686 Clone

If using linear supply need beefy soft start.

Voltage 57V-70V depending on heatsink and output transistors.

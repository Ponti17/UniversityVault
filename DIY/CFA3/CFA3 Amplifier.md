# CFA3 Balanced Headphone Amplifier
---

## Voltages
---
Works between $\pm20V$ and $\pm30V$.

2x 50VA 30VAC trafo. 

## ZF / SS
---
For ZF (Zero Feedback), connect all ZF jumpers.
For SS (Super Symmetri), connect all SS jumpers.

## Bias
---
Bias should be 150-200 mA. 
Read voltage across 1R resistors.

Bias is set by the 5k pot.

## Matching
---
LEDs should be matched.

Q14/Q16, Q12/Q13, Q5/Q17.

## Parts Selection
---
NO WIREWOUNDS.

OPA551?

Replace THAT340 with 3SK389 and 2SJ109. (Linear Systems LSK389 and LSJ109)

## Optional Parts
---
600p capacitors not neccessary.

## Attenuator
---
10K

Cheap: RK27

Good: Goldpoint Stepped Attenuator

## Grounding
---
Connect each amp board directly to their corresponding GRLV.

Reference GRLV grounds and pot grounds to chassi ground (star ground).

A 10R resister can be used to connect GRLV grounds to chassis.

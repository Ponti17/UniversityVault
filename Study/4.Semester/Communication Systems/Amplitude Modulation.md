For a signal $x(t)$ we modulate it with a higher frequency $f_c$ carrier by multiplication

Multiplication in time is convolution in frequency domain

We then transmit the signal. The receiver sees the signal along with other frequencies from other transmissions of no interest. We use a bandpass filter, and then multiply with the carrier wave again. At last a LP filter is used.

A baseband signal is the actual signal e.g. a binary transmission. The passband signal is the resulting modulated signal ready for transmission. For a binary baseband signal

the resulting passband signal at carrier frequency $f_c$

The data rate is then the number of bits per second (bps)
$$ \textrm{data rate} = \frac{1}{T} \textrm{bps} $$
For a 10Mbps data rate the bandwidth would then be 20 MHz. 

For a digital transmission with more than 2 amplitude values the data rate increases for the same bandwidth. For 4 voltage levels the data rate would be multiplied since a 2-bit binary value can be transmitted at a time.

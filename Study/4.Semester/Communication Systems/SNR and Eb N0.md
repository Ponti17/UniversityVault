For a baseband random signal in time domain, its PSD and PSD after AM
![[base3.png]]
The power is the area under the PSD. The spectrum for white gaussian noise
![[white1.png]]
We apply a passband filter to the signal. The noise component will then have the power $(N_0/2)W$
![[noisepow.png]]
The power of the signal
![[sigpow.png]]
The SNR is then the ratio of the power of the signal to the power of the noise
$$ \textrm{SNR} = \frac{P}{N_0W} $$

For a system function
$$ X(z) = \frac{P(z)}{Q(z)}$$
where $P(z)$ and $Q(z)$ are polynomials in $z$. 

Zeros: The values of $z$ for which $X(z) = 0$.
Poles: The values of $z$ for which $X(z) = \infty$.

Roots of $P(z)$ are zeros. Denoted by $o$ in the z-plane.
Roots of $Q(z)$ are poles. Denoted by $x$ in the z-plane.

## Complex Conjugate
---
If we have the complex number
$$ 3 + 4j $$
The complex conjugate
$$ 3 - 4j $$

## Conjugate Symmetric Signal
---
If have the signal $x(t)$. The signal after time reversal $x(-t)$. The complex conjugate of $x(-t)$ is
$$ x^{\ast} (-t) = x(t) $$
The complex signal
$$ x(t) = a(t) + jb(t) $$
After time reversal
$$ x(-t) = a(-t) + jb(-t) $$
The conjugate
$$ x^{\ast}(-t) = a(-t) - jb(-t) $$
So
$$ a(t) = a(-t) $$
$$ b(t) = -b(-t) $$
So we see that $a$ is even and $b$ is odd. If we consider the signal
$$ x(t) = t^2 + j \sin(t) $$
We see that $a(t) = t^2$ is even and $b(t) = \sin(t)$ is odd, so the signal is conjugate symmetric.

## Conjugate Antisymmetric Signal
---
The condition for conjuagte antisymmetri
$$ x(t) = -x^{\ast}(-t) $$
A signal has the components
$$ x(t) = a(t) + jb(t) $$
We perform time reversal
$$ x(-t) = a(-t) + jb(-t) $$
The complex conjugate of $x(-t)$
$$ x^{\ast}(-t) = a(-t) - jb(-t) $$
Amplitude reversal
$$ -x^{\ast}(-t) = -a(-t) + jb(-t) $$
So we have
$$ a(t) = -a(-t) $$
$$ b(t) = b(-t) $$
So $a$ is odd and $b$ is even.

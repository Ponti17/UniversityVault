# Power Consumption
---
There are two types of power consumption in a CMOS circuit:

- Dynamic power consumption
- Static power consumption.

**Dynamic power consumption** is the power needed to charge or discharge the load capacitance. It is the power consumed when the circuit is actively switching. The dynamic power consumed when a capacitor is charged and discharged at a frequency of $f$ is
$$ P_{dyn} = CV_{DD}^2f $$
**Static power consumption** is the power consumption due to the fact that an OFF transistor is leaky and a small amount of current flows between power and ground.
$$ P_{sta} = I_{sta} V_{DD} $$

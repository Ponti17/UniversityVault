# Stabilitet
---
The stability (resistance to oscillations) can be determined from $S$ parameters.

If $|\Gamma_S * \Gamma_{in}|> 1$, the series goes towards infinite, and oscillations will build up until it reaches saturation.

Transducer power gain
$$ G_T = \frac{P_L}{P_{av,s}} $$
Shows the amount of power we end up with in the load with respect to the power delivered from the source. When the input and output networks are matched
$$ G_T = |S_{21}|^2 $$
If we have a unilateral amplifier (no backwards gain $S_{12} = 0$)
$$ \Gamma_{in} = S_{11}, \hspace{20pt} \Gamma_{out} = S_{22} $$
